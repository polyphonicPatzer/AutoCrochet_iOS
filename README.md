## Project Description:

AutoCrochet generates crochet patterns for a simple hat based on given dimensions of the stitch to be used. Its secondary feature is that it helps the user track how far along they are in the pattern. They can mark down that they've completed a certain set of stitches by making a noise. I have many ideas for improving the app, but for the scope of this project, I will only implement two or three of the following: A revamping of the user interface (the main target of my next steps listed below), introduce more complex hat patterns, introduce the option to create a sphere, data permanence, and reworking the pattern generating algorithm.

## Technologies Involved:

* Swift
* Macbook Pro
* Xcode

## Write down all the technologies that you employed to finish your project. The above 

## Next Steps:
* User can select the volume of the noise needed to mark the set of stitches.
* User can select whether they want the measurement system of the app to be in metric or imperial.
* Improve the layout and aesthetics of the input screen. 
* Change the colors and aesthetics of the list screens.
